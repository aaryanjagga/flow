Softly is a minimal, privacy-first period tracking web app.
It was built with one intention:
to create a gentle, non-clinical space for tracking — without pressure, predictions, or data collection.
No accounts.  
No cloud.  
No noise.
Just something that feels calm.
# What Softly Does...
- Lets you manually log the **first day of your period**
- Records entries locally in your browser
- Notices patterns over time and shows whether a cycle feels:
  - Normal
  - Early
  - Delayed
- Highlights period days on a simple calendar
- Displays a soothing line that changes on every app open
- 
That’s it. Nothing more than what’s needed.

## 🌿 Design Philosophy...
Most period trackers focus on prediction, optimization, or fertility.
Softly intentionally does not.

- No fertility tracking
- No ovulation logic
- No medical advice
- No alerts or anxiety-driven messaging

The goal is not to control the body —
but to observe it gently.

## 🔒 Privacy

All data is stored **locally in your browser** using `localStorage`.

- No sign-ups
- No analytics
- No external APIs
- No data ever leaves your device

Your data stays with you. Always.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks. No dependencies.


## 🚧 Project Status

Softly is an early-stage personal project.
It may evolve slowly — by design.

Gentle things don’t rush.

## 🌙 Closing Note

Softly does not replace care or presence.
It simply exists for moments when gentleness matters.

Built quietly.
